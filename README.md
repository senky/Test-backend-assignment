# Test backend assignment

Task is to create backend application in Node.js using any SQL database. This application should communicate with frontend via GraphQL. There is no need to do frontend in this assessment. You can use any libraries you may consider useful. The assessment is to create an application for book catalogue.

## Use cases:

- User should be able to register and log in.
- Logged in User should be able to add new book, edit existing book, and delete book. User should be able to “travel back” in time and see older state of any book.
- Anonymous user should be able to find some book by author name or book title.
- Pagination is not required but is big plus.

## Minimum data requirements:

- User: email, password
- Book: title, author, year of publication, genres, rating

You can model SQL schema as you consider best. The same applies for GraphQL schema.

## Additional informations:

- Feel free to use any additional library you might need for completing this project, or change structure or anything
- We would like to see, how will you solve this task in terms of end result precision, code quality & readability
